Getting Started
===============

Response Meta
-------------

All response contains a ``meta`` property for clients to identify the status of the message.

For a normal response, ``status`` code must be ``200``. Any other status code means that the request cannot complete successfully.

Below shows an example of a success :ref:`method-GetApiBalance` response

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "apiBalances": [
      {
        "apiBalanceId": 7,
        "currencyCode": "usd",
        "balance": 2044.233
      }
    ],
    "correlationId": "0HM9VIKSKH2CB:00000002",
    "meta": {
      "status": 200,
      "data": {},
      "errorCode": null,
      "error": {}
    },
    "totalNumberOfRecords": 1
  }

Below shows a example of a fail :ref:`method-GetWarehouse` response (invalid ``warehouseId``)

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "correlationId": "0HM9VIKSKH2CF:00000002",
    "meta": {
      "status": 400,
      "data": {},
      "errorCode": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
      "error": {
        "warehouseId": "The value 'invalid' is not valid."
      }
    }
  }
